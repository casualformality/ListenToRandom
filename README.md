This project is inspired by Hatnote's [Listen to Wikipedia(https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia) Project for people without consistent internet connections.

## About

Dynamic, pseudo-random background noise generation

## Sound

The sound included here were copied from the Listen to Wikipedia project

## Notes

If you're running OS X El Capitan or greater, use sounds_pyglet.py.  Otherwise, run sounds.py. CoreAudio was deprecated in El Capitan, and PyGame relies on it, so it breaks. PyGlet works, but itsn't as good.
